# Checkers-AI

Planning on creating a q-learning rl agent that can play checkers at least better than I can

Changed to a deep q network since q-learning requires too much memory. 

Trained on 150 000 games of self play. Achieves a 95% win rate against a randomly moving opponent but gets beaten by a minimax agent with a heurisitic function that is the ratio of red to black pieces.

Tried making a GUI but it pygames was a bit too complicated to use so that is temporarily on hold.

Still can't play better than I can
